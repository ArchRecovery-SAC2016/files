# BoxPlot Results
-Figure "BoxPlot_Results" shows the score obtained by the participants in Group 1 and Group 2, in the systems using Visual Basic and Java language. From the results, it is noticeable that the score obtained using one technique was lower than the score obtained using two techniques. We should also note that results are grouped into Visual Basic (lef-side) and Java (right side) software systems to show the accuracy gain disregards the language.

-Figure "BoxPlot_SystemLanguage" details the scores when taken into account the language of object systems. A first observation shows that visually the programming language has no influence on the results look similar.

-Figure "BoxPlot_Order"  details the comparison when taken into account the order of approaches. A first observation on the figure shows that the order of the first technique to use has no influence, since results look similar.
